### **1. Connecting the Framework Core**

The first step is to connect the main core of the **SIMAI Framework**. To do this, use the CDN. Insert the corresponding `<link>` tag into the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/simai/ui-core@main/distr/core.min.css">
```

### **2. Connecting the Framework Utilities**

After connecting the core, you should add the **SIMAI Framework** utilities, which provide additional classes and tools for development. Use the CDN and also add the corresponding `<link>` tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/simai/ui-utilities@main/distr/full/utility.full.min.css">
```

### **3. Using SIMAI Framework Components and Utilities**

Once the core and utilities are connected, you can proceed to use the various modifiers and components provided by the **SIMAI Framework**. Refer to the framework's documentation to explore the available classes and best practices for implementing them in your project.
